Description

Mini capacitive touch sensor module based on the dedicated TTP223
touch sensor IC.  The module provides a single integrated touch
sensing area of 11 x 10.5mm with a sensor range of ~5mm.  An on-board
LED will give a visual indication of when the sensor is triggered.

When triggered the modules output will switch from its idle low
state to high (default operation).

Solder jumpers allow for reconfiguring its mode of operation to be
either active low or toggle output.

    Voltage : 2.5v to 5.5v

    Supply current : (Vcc = 5V) : 6uA (Idle) 16mA (Active)

    Max sensor range : ~5mm

    Trigger setting mode : (1->Short; 0->No Short)

    Jumper links
