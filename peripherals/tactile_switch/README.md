## Tactile Switches with a Yellow Base

When pressed, tactile switches with a yellow base connect the "Tip" on the TRRS connector to "Ring 1" and
can be connected directly into an analog (yellow) controller input. 

## Tactile Switches with a Black Base

When pressed, tactile switches with a black base connects the "Tip" on the TRRS connector to "Sleeve", which
__will short power to ground if plugged directly into a controller__. A Switch Adaptor module should be used when
connecting a tactile switch, with a black base, to a controller analog (yellow) input.
